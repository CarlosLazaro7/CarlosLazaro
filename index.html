        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">From 2010-2016, I played the piano for my parish every Sunday. Throughout the years, I held free music lessons where I would teach children and adults music theory. I was able to lead the students through the basics of music to make reading sheet music easier. I was also the youth band's creator at my parish, where I would set up weekly practices and set up times and places to play with the band, such as youth nights, mass, and spiritual retreats. While at my parish, I was also a student leader during the summer camps offered for young students, leading them around different activities. I also helped in the fish fry, where I would lead other volunteers to their appropriate positions and help anyone who needed help or needed their spot filled. During spiritual retreats, I would also help lead hikes, events, worships, and many other activities. I was also very well known for being there whenever someone needed the aid of any kind, and I would introduce new students into the program to make them comfortable and slowly open up with others. In high school, I was the president of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, more commonly known as FCA. I organized multiple club meetings and board meetings to discuss what needed to be done. I was also the President of Communications for the "Link Crew" class at my school my senior year, where I was in charge of all social media, flyers, and I would create videos for the students. I would also take photos of our events, as well as communicate with other staff when needed. I was in charge of my Link crew team, where we had to control all media aspects of certain events. During the 2019 summer, I was part of the Foreign exchange program where students from different parts of China came to my school, and we had to be their partners and guide them around the school while getting to know them, to this day. Lastly, I was also part of the 2019 drama performance, where I had two days to figure out and manage a team to put up and take down all the crops as fast as possible while simultaneously being very careful not to make noise or break any props.<br><br>

        My strongest skill is determination. The determination to keep going regardless of any issue or obstacle I might encounter. The determination to keep a positive attitude in all I do and not let small failures stop me and feel remorse. The determination to take risks and embracing any failure that might come, but hope for success. A time I showed extreme dedication was when I had joined the water polo team without knowing how to swim. On the first day I almost drowned, but that didnâ€™t scare me and so I pushed myself to the end of practice. I joined club swim to increase the amount of time I was able to swim because I was determined to show what I was made of and to better my swimming abilities. Day in and day out I would practice my swimming, eventually being able to go from a one minute and twenty second 50-meter freestlyle time, down to thirty-five seconds in the span of four months. Although I was not the fastest on the team, I definitely gave it my all, regardless of how much work it took. An academic example of such determination was during my junior year of high school. Before this year, I had not taken academics too seriously, thinking that college was not for me, therefore, my grade point average and dedication for school were not serious. But this all changed during my junior year of high school where I realized that I wanted to attend college and graduate with a degree. During my junior year I pushed myself to my limit, taking nine class- although some of the classes were not extremely difficult they definitely took up time. With nine classes on my plate, I was able to get an eight Aâ€™s my first semester, with my lowest grade being an 88%, and seven Aâ€™s my second semester with my lowest grade being an 88% again. I gave this year my all, I stayed determined regardless of how busy I was at times, I never let this distract me from my end goal. My determination for success. I kept a positive attitude at all times, regardless of failure or success, I knew what I was aiming for and I was not going to let anything stop me from reaching that goal. <br><br>

        As I have had team experience through school and other activities, I have witnessed such issues arise. The most important thing to do first is to try to get both teams to relax and discuss their issue calmly since nothing will come out of arguing. Communication is the most crucial tool to use in this scenario. I would try to get both parties to express themselves one at a time and find a middle ground, regardless of how small it might be, finding a middle ground is significant to reaching an agreement. After finding a middle ground, I would encourage them to discuss ways both parties could have a part of their idea included while including the otherâ€™s opinion. This would lead to a more considerable middle ground, leading to a solution in the end. Suppose a solution is not able to be agreed upon. In that case, it is still best to get both parties to make sure that whatever issues might be going on, they should not take it personally as everyone is entitled to their opinions, and that words will only affect and hurt you if you let them hurt you. I would remind them that we are a team, and that we all get along very well, and that they should not allow a small issue to break such collaboration and friendship.
